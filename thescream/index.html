        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">Everybody left. The Earth went quiet.</span></p>

        *
        
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">Everything was supposed to be done with equipment. For decades, satellites and rovers
        explored, taking readings and transmitting them back to distant colonies. The first rover going
        quiet was unexpected, but explicable: the planet was still full of animals and antagonistic
        weather forces that could easily put paid to the best laid plans. And then a second blinked out of
        existence, and with a static screech, the satellites stopped talking. Once again, the world went
        quiet.</span></p>  
        
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">So they sent people. PhD students, actually; some straight into the fields of their once-
        theoretical research, and others are taken for their expertise and the chance of a year away</span></p>
        
        from overtime and paltry, late salaries.
        They send Mahira and Sel to the last nuclear reactor to erupt like a dormant volcano. This is
        where the first rover died.
        
        *
        
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">RX-2041B sits listless and forever unmoving in the grass. Though there’s no sign of damage to
        its hull or inner machinery, it’s simply stopped working, and nothing Sel does can revive it. His
        fingers go still when the realisation hits, chest rising and falling with ragged breath, crouched
        over a lost companion. “It shouldn’t have died,” he says, both a statement of fact and an
        expression of mourning. RX-2041B is almost as old as Sel himself and spent its long life
        discovering things that were lost in the interplanetary move.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">They call it Laika and bury it.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“Won’t it disturb the radiation in the soil?” Mahira had asked tentatively, but Sel had simply
        shrugged</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino"> “Don’t you think Laika deserves it?”</span></p>
            <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">Before they finish the burial, they both throw three handfuls of dirt into the earth and Mahira
        apologises for its disturbance. When the grave is finished and marked with a pattern of stones
        and twigs, she bows her head. “To Allah we belong and to Allah we return,” she says, and
        reaches out for Sel’s hand. Laika was one of the first rovers ever sent back to Earth, one of the
        first connections to a lost homeland. Most people feel that they belong here, on this world, and
        are simply waiting for the day they might return. Mahira isn’t so sure she belongs anywhere –
        but even so, she feels in awe of this place.</span></p>
        
        
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">They’ve come here following a death, but the world is full of life, from the thick grass that their
        boots sink into to the birds that sing in the trees above their heads. Nature ignores disaster.
        Determined above all, it grows and grows, finds its roots as ivy creeps up the sides of a leaching
        power plant, flowers peeking out from cracks in the architecture. Ecosystems persist with a
        faster turnover rate.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino"> Nothing grows on Mars; everything grows here.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino"> Mahira could watch this new world – or old world – for hours. Once they’ve assembled a camp
        around their landing shuttle, she does just that, sitting on the rough earth and watching the sun
        set in the sky, painting it in oranges and pinks and blues and blacks. Sel brings her food and
        reminds her to eat, settling beside her. “This was your research, wasn’t it?” he asks, as if he
        didn’t read all of her work on the ship here. “The effects of radiation on terran ecosystems.”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“I didn’t think I’d ever see it up close,” she admits. Laika’s automated research has formed
        largely the basis of her own. She should feel sadder, but can’t find her emotions in this sea of
        experience. Everything is happening all at once, and she hasn’t slowed down enough for her
        feelings to catch up and overwhelm her. But maybe she’ll never cry for Laika at all. Doctors call
        it alexithymia. “I didn’t think it was going to be this... green.”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">Sel laughs. “It deserves to be the Green Planet more than Mars ever deserved to be the Red
        one.”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“Maybe we’ll never find out what killed Laika,” she muses. “It feels like there’s so much here,
        and we’ve only just landed.” She’s noticed it already – the changes in birdsong, the quieting of
        the rustling as night sets in, the eruption of strange and uncanny cries from nocturnal animals.
        She prepared by listening to old clips, but the noises make gooseflesh prickle on her arms, old
        human instincts coming back to life. It’s easy to understand strange Earth myths now; creatures
        of the seas and land, crossing cultures and times, born out of strange encounters. She’s afraid
        but she isn’t, drawn by curiosity.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“We should do the hard bit first,” Sel suggests, talking with his mouth full. Mahira pulls a face.
        “Power plant first. See what’s in there, and then we can go and frolic with quadrats for the rest
        of the trip.”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">Mahira rolls her eyes, but laughs anyway. She can’t help it. “That is not what biologists do,” she
        says.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“We did it in high school,” Sel says, “and I hit somebody in the face. That was the end of my
        biology career right there.” Even as the dark is swallowing up the finer details of his face, the
        important things still remain: the round flush of his cheeks, the well-worn lines around his smile.
        And then, finally, his face disappears into the night.</span></p>
        
    
        *
        
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">Mahira barely sleeps. Even with earplugs in, she can hear: and instead of adjusting to the noise,
        she’s becoming more and more afraid. The screams feel closer, more human. They intrude into
        her mind with visceral images: a woman’s guts spilling out as a knife cleaves through her chest;
        someone who has just lost their entire family, howling despair at a cruel master; a man with his
        leg caught in a bear trip, incised viciously by rusty metal. When she opens her eyes, she can
        still feel those images clawing at the edges of her consciousness, holding onto her mind even
        as she begins morning prayers with the first light of dawn.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">She shouts at Sel instead of eating breakfast. She shouldn’t. But she can’t help herself.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">An hour later, when they’re on the outskirts of the nuclear power plant and preparing to go
        inside, she says she’s hungry. Her stomach hurts as it grows and contracts, and as she thinks
        how stupid it was to lash out, Sel presses a protein bar into her hand. “There you go,” he says.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“Oh,” she says, touched. “Thank you."</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">It feels strange to come upon the open door of an abandoned building; it feels as if it should be
        shut and padlocked, but across the overgrown town, doors and windows stay open as if the
        residents just disappeared. She feels her heart skip a few beats as Sel pushes open the door,
        which creaks and groans with the exertion, wondering what might lurk beyond; but it’s just a
        long expanse of dark. Sel clicks on his torch, cutting through the unknown with a beam of light,
        dust swirling with motion. “You didn’t sleep last night?” he asks.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“Bad dreams,” she says, a half-truth. If only she’d been asleep for them. The thoughts still hang
        over her like a fog.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“Me too,” he says. “I kept wishing I would wake up.”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">Something scuttles in the corridor, and he starts. Mahira jumped, too, but she scolds herself.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“Probably a mouse,” she says. “Or a rat. We’re sharing the place.” Sometimes it’s easy here to
        forget that sounds have sources; they’re not just an ambient layer over the world, not like the
        earth sound files Mahira liked to listen to at home. She finishes the protein bar and retrieves her
        own torch. “Should we split up?”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“Nothing good has ever happened when a group splits up,” Sel points out. Mahira sighs.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“We’re not in a movie,” she says. “We could cover ground faster.”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">Sel doesn’t look happy with it, but he concedes the point. Mahira reassures him that they have
        communication devices and trackers, so if anything does happen, she’ll be there in a matter of
        moments. She doesn’t like the idea of being alone with her intrusive thoughts either, but she has
        an unfortunate lifetime of practice, and she lets her breathing slow as she sets out in one
        direction. She’s canvassing the ground floor first while Sel heads for the stairs, the rickety
        elevator overgrown with moss and almost uncertainly untrustworthy anyway. The dust is so
        thick that she pauses to retrieve a face mask from her pack, tying the straps together tight at the
        back of her hijab.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">She begins to pick her way through the rooms, through the dark. An old staff room has half-filled
        coffee cups with ecosystems growing on the rims; there’s a bird’s nest filled with anxious chicks
        in the corner of another. “Sorry,” she says on instinct. “Didn’t mean to disturb you.”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">Under the mask, she’s keenly aware of her breathing, regulating it carefully; but even then, she
        feels that they’re coming in short. Despite herself, panic grips her chest like a vice: fear of the
        dark, fear of the unknown, fear of the radioactivity seeping its way through her body and
        poisoning her organs and the fear that the decontamination chamber in the ship is just a fiction
        and that she’ll die here. It overwhelms her at once, flooding her system, thought after thought
        after thought, tying themselves to the mast of last night. She stumbles against the wall and slips
        down, pulling her knees up to her chest, and activates the comms link.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“Panic attack,” she wheezes to Sel, the rational part of her mind speaking even though the rest
        of her is convinced that death is coming this way.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“You want me to come down or do you just wanna talk?” he asks.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“Just talk,” she says.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“I mean, this is the most rational place to have a panic attack, don’t you think? It’s dark and
        scary and radioactive and there are mice everywhere who seem to get their kicks from scaring
        me.” His voice quiets for a moment, but she can hear him moving, and then the sound of a door
        shutting behind him. “Oh, wow. I’ve just found the control room for the reactor. This is where it
        all happened, huh?” He very audibly trips over a chair, and despite herself, Mahira breaks
        through the feeling of hopelessness for just long enough to laugh at him. “Man, I thought the
        radiation was going to be the health and safety risk here, not the furniture!” More walking. “Oh,
        there’s a screen here, and I’m guessing that this used to be a live feed of the reactor and not so
        that they could watch daytime TV? Maybe I can get it back on.” She can hear what sounds like
        Sel simply hitting the screen. “What did you find on the ground floor?”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“Just staff rooms and break rooms. Lockers and old uniforms. It’s weird, because part of me
        feels like somebody is going to just walk back in, even though clearly no-one has been here for
        decades.”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“In my nightmare last night, I was here on my own and somebody tapped me on the shoulder
        and I turned around and it was this guy with his flesh literally rotting and slipping off his skeleton,
        and he said ‘excuse me’ and put his uniform on; and then there were dozens of them, guys with
        no faces just walking around me like it’s business as usual...” Sel trails off. “That was not a
        reassuring story at all for your panic attack. Wow. Sorry, ’hira.”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“I guess we can add rotting workers to my list of irrational fears.”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“What else is on there? Quicksand? Acid rain?”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“Anglerfish. They’re a deep sea species here, and they have this ray that emits light and hangs
        in front of them like a lantern, which they use to attract prey into their big, sharp teeth.”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“I feel like that’s a rational fear.”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“They’re not that big, and I wouldn’t meet one unless we went deep sea diving while we were
        here, which we don’t have the equipment for.”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“Yeah, but they do sound scary. Ooh, hello... I think I’ve got something here, Mahira. Maybe
        when you feel better, you should come up and see this.” There are a few moments where all
        she can hear is Sel exerting himself over something or another, and then a delighted gasp.
        “Yes! The screen’s on. I can see the reactor! Okay, this is in black and white for some reason –
        I’m guessing they were just really cheap? – but let’s see... That must be where the reactor
        exploded and melted down, and I can see scorch marks, but what’s that? There’s this black
        thing in the reactor and I’m not sure what it is. It’s really dark, like Vantablack, it doesn’t even
        look like it’s real. Hey, maybe we could head over to the reactor together and have a look
        tomorrow if we bring the protective gear... Is that moving?”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“What?”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“I think it’s moving. What the hell? Is that– is that a tentacle?”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“Sel? What are you seeing? Are you sure this is real?”</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">“I don’t know,” he says, and then the comms link cuts out. The hum of slight static that sat
        behind his voice cuts out, and when Mahira shouts his name, nothing responds. Like the
        satellites and the rovers, like Laika, Sel goes silent. Mahira fumbles in her pockets, pulls out the
        tracker, searches for the little dot that’s Sel–</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">There’s nothing. He’s off the radar. He’s gone.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">Mahira’s chest tightens. But this time she runs, trying not to trip over anything in the cloak of
        darkness that envelopes the windowless power plant, desperately following the path carved out
        for her by the torch in her hand, following the signs up the stairs and checking room after room
        until finally she steps into the control room. What looks like ink has been spilled on the floor, like
        black blood, and she hurries over to the screen, still displaying what seems to be footage from
        the reactor. The current Earth time displays in the top left corner, the date on the right. Sel isn’t
        here, and she can’t see anything unexpected on the screen; but the ink leaves a trail, dripping
        across the floor like blood at a hospital.</span></p>

         <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">Mahira squeezes her eyes shut, prays to Allah, prays for His light and safety, and begins to
        follow the trail.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">Drip, drip. Drip, drip. The squeak of her shoes against the floor. Drip, drip. Drip, drip.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">She wants Sel to say something funny. She wants to be back at camp. She wants to go home.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">Instead, she steps out onto the walkway above the destroyed nuclear reactor, watching
        something of pure black crawl like an octopus across the grey metal and settle itself in the heart
        of the reactor, the hollowed-out explosion its nest. There is no Sel here. She wants to believe
        that he’s alive somewhere, but there’s a finality in the way he went silent; just stopped, like
        Laika, inexplicably over. The creature doesn’t seem to have eyes, but its surface is so dark that
        she can’t see anything, the shadow of all shadows. She can feel it watching nonetheless.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">It screams inside her head.</span></p>
        <p style="text-indent:18pt; line-height:110%"><span style="font-family:Palatino">It’s the loudest scream she’s ever heard, the scream of everything; of a reactor exploding, a
        body melting away with radiation sickness, the unstoppable growth of malignant tumours, organ
        failure, the cracking open of the earth, tornadoes and floods and fires and people fleeing their
        homes and finding no safe refuge, knives and bullets plunged into chests, the crying of children.
        Everything all at once. Everything. The scream of old Earth, the song of its destruction, a
        piercing cry to someone who fled it.</span></p>
